# The Data
The Stop, Search and Frisk Data was obtained directly from the NYPD site, which contains a repository of data on the program dating back to 2003. Data on the number of crimes per year was manually obtained from the NYPD crime dashboard and entered into an excel spreadsheet that was later converted into a csv.

# Limitations
The data collection format was changed in 2014. As such, many of the fields were different between the 2012 and 2019 dataset. There is also a posibility that with the policy updates some of the definitions may have changed. I was interested in exploring data about stops that resulted in the suspect being shot, but that metric was not tracked until 2014.
